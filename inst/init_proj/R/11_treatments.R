# Dose Intensity per cycle --------------------------------------------------------------------

# Dose reductions or delays in administration are presented in the following tables per patient-cycle and per patient respectively.

# Dose reductions/delay (/cycle) --------------------------------------------------------------
# Comment: Dependency between cycles of the same patient is not taken into account in the cycle analysis and should therefore be interpreted with caution

# Dose reductions/delay (/patient) ------------------------------------------------------------

# End of the treatment ------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Toxic discontinuations ----------------------------------------------------------------------
# Toxicities related to the treatment studied leading to discontinuation of treatment
